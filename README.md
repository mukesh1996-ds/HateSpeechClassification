# **Hate Speech Classification**

Hate Speech Classification is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task focused on identifying and categorizing content that contains hateful, offensive, or abusive language. It plays a crucial role in moderating online platforms to promote respectful and inclusive communication. 

#### **Problem Statements**

The rise of user-generated content on social media platforms has led to a significant increase in the spread of hate speech and offensive language online. This type of harmful content can incite violence, spread misinformation, and negatively impact targeted individuals or communities. Manual moderation is time-consuming, expensive, and inconsistent, making automated solutions necessary for real-time and large-scale content filtering.
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify online text content into predefined categories such as hate speech, offensive language, or neutral/benign content. The system should be capable of analyzing short texts (e.g., tweets, comments, posts) and determining whether they contain language that violates content policies or community standards.
This problem involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification using machine learning or deep learning models. The final model will help in automatically flagging or filtering harmful content, thereby contributing to safer and more inclusive digital spaces.

#### **Proposed Solution**:

To address the problem of automated hate speech classification, we propose using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based deep learning model, specifically tailored for sequential text data. RNNs are well-suited for understanding the contextual flow of natural language, making them effective for detecting hate speech patterns that depend on word order and semantic context.

* Solution Architecture
    * Data Preprocessing
        * Text Cleaning: Remove URLs, HTML tags, special characters, numbers, and emojis.
        * Lowercasing: Convert all text to lowercase.
        * Tokenization: Split sentences into individual words or tokens.
        * Stopword Removal: Optionally remove common words that don't carry significant meaning.
        * Padding: Ensure all sequences have the same length using padding/truncation.
    * Embedding Layer
        * Convert tokens into dense vector representations using:
    * Pre-trained embeddings (e.g., GloVe, Word2Vec), or
        * Trainable embedding layer (initialized randomly and learned during training).
    * RNN Layer
        * Apply an RNN architecture (e.g., LSTM or GRU) to capture contextual information and long-term dependencies in the text.
        * Use one or more layers depending on the complexity and dataset size.
        * Fully Connected (Dense) Layer
    * Flatten the output of the RNN.
        * Pass through one or more dense layers to learn abstract features.
    * Output Layer
        * Use a SoftMax activation for multi-class classification (hate, offensive, neutral), 
        * Use a Sigmoid activation for binary classification (hate vs. non-hate)
